(* In order to determine the proof, use interactive mode: 
   set interactiveMode = true.
The proof is as follows: *)

proof {
  success; (* for fullB(A,k,x) && fullA(B,k',x) ==> k = k'. *)
  crypto enc rkB;
  crypto sign rkS;
  crypto sign rkA;
  success;
  auto
}

(*

Authentication in one direction only.
There is no injectivity (replay attack possible).
The certificates are not authenticated because our definition of
signatures allows the adversary to forge a second signature for
a message that has been signed.
