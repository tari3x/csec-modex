(* Denning-Sacco key distribution protocol. (original, flawed version) *)

(*
Secrecy of keyA is wrong here, because the adversary can register the
public signature key of A with another identity C. Then
A sends (A, pkA, certA, B, pkB, certB, { {k}skA }pkB)
the adversary sends to B (C, pkA, certC, B, pkB, certB, { {k}skA}pkB)
which is ok, because pkA is also the public key of C, so
B publishes k since he thinks it is a key with C. 

query k:shkey, x:bitstring;
	event fullB(A,k,x) ==> fullA(B,k,x).
is wrong due to the standard attack against Denning-Sacco.

query k:shkey, k':shkey, x:bitstring;
	event fullB(A,k,x) && fullA(B,k',x) ==> k = k'. 
is true.

(* In order to determine the proof, use interactive mode: 
   set interactiveMode = true.
The proof is as follows: *)

  success; (* for fullB(A,k,x) && fullA(B,k',x) ==> k = k'. *)
