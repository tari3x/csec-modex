(* Note: the system applies first INT-PTXT, then IND-CCA2 on the same key.
   After these two transformations, we end up with three cases at each decryption:
	a) the ciphertext comes from an encryption -> we get the cleartext x[j]
	b) the ciphertext does not come from an encryption, but decrypts to some encrypted cleartext x[j]
	   -> the cleartext is x[j], but we still have a test dec2(y,kgen2(r)) = injbot(x[j]), which would
	   prevent showing the secrecy of x[j]. This case gets eliminated by simplification thanks to
	   a dependency analysis: x[j] contains a nonce which is used only in such equality
	   tests, so the adversary has no information on this nonce. y comes from the adversary, so
	   the equality test is always wrong
	c) the decryption fails -> we get bottom
