(* PFDH signature scheme
   The prover finds the same probability as for FDH, not the better
   reduction by J.S.Coron. This is ok, because we do not give the
   hypothesis of random self-reducibility.
 *)

(*
set interactiveMode = true.

Proof:

crypto hash
crypto mf r r_35 r_38
crypto f r
success

The prover finds the proof automatically, like for fdh, but is unable to find
the better reduction which exists for this scheme...
