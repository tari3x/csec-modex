(* encryption scheme by Bellare and Rogaway, Random Oracles are
Practical: a Paradigm for Designing Efficient Protocols, CCS'93, 
section 3.2: 
	E(x) = f(r) || H(r) xor x || H2(r || x) 
(CCA2) -- in progress *)

set interactiveMode = true.

(* The proof is as follows:

crypto hash2
crypto hash
remove_assign binder pk
crypto f r x_67
crypto xor @6_r_113

The game is transformed into a game that does not depend on menc.
We can then easily show that if menc is defined by 
"in(c, (m1,m2); new b1:bool; let menc = if b1 then m1 else m2"
then the secrecy of b1 is preserved.
(The system fails to show that directly; see encryptBR93-2.)
