(* encryption scheme by Bellare and Rogaway, Random Oracles are
Practical: a Paradigm for Designing Efficient Protocols, CCS'93, 
section 3.2: 
	E(x) = f(r) || H(r) xor x || H2(r || x) 
(CCA2) -- in progress *)

set interactiveMode = true.

(* The proof is as follows:

crypto hash2
crypto hash
remove_assign binder pk
crypto f r x_67
crypto xor @6_r_113

After crypto f r x_20, we have to simplify:

    find  suchthat defined(cT, aT, bT, r_44) && ((a = aT) && ((b = bT) && (c = r_44))) then
      yield
    else
      find  suchthat defined(x_32, r_120, menc) && otheruses(r_120) && (f'(pkgen'(r), x_32) = a) then
        let m: hasht = xor(r_120, b) in
        find  suchthat defined(menc, r_44) && otheruses(r_44) && (m = menc) then
        if (c = r_44) then
        out(c6[!_31], m)
      [...]
|
  in(c7, (m1: hasht, m2: hasht));
  new b1: bool;
  let menc: hasht = test(b1, m1, m2) in
  new x_32: seed;
  let aT: seed = f'(pkgen'(r), x_32) in
  new r_120: hasht;
  let bT: hasht = xor(r_120, menc) in
  new r_44: hasht2;
  let cT: hasht2 = cst_hasht2 in
  out(c8, (aT, bT, r_44))

elsefind([],[cT, aT, bT, r_44], (a = aT) && ((b = bT) && (c = r_44)))
defined(x_32, r_120, menc, r_44) implies defined(cT, aT, bT, r_44)
so not((a = aT) && ((b = bT) && (c = r_44))).
m = menc, m = xor(r_120,b), so xor(r_120,b) = menc
bT = xor(r_120, menc), so bT = xor(r_120, xor(r_120,b)) = b.
a = f'(pkgen'(r), x_32) = aT
c = r_44
So contradiction after then test "if (c = r_44) then"
but currently the system does not find that contradiction.

Substitutions:
(c[!_31] = r_44)
(a[!_31] = f'(pkgen'(r), x_32))
(x_121 >>= cst_seed)
(cT >>= cst_hasht2)
(menc >>= test(b1, m1, m2))
(bT >>= xor(r_120, menc))
(aT >>= f'(pkgen'(r), x_32))
(m[!_31] >>= xor(r_120, b[!_31]))
Facts:
(m[!_31] = menc)
(b[!_31] <> bT)
Elsefind:
for all ; not(defined(cT, aT, bT, r_44) && ((a[!_31] = aT) && ((b[!_31] = bT) && (c[!_31] = r_44))))

The system fails to orient (m[!_31] = menc), because it is rewritten
into xor(r_120, b[!_31]) = test(b1, m1, m2)
     b[!_31] <> xor(r_120, test(b1, m1, m2)) 

The system does not really handle the equations of xor well...
Adding
forall x:hasht,y:hasht,a:bool,b:hasht,c:hasht; (xor(x,y) = test(a,b,c)) =
(y = xor(x, test(a,b,c))).
does not work either...

Adding
fun xor'(hasht,hasht):hasht [commut].
forall x:hasht,y:hasht,a:hasht; (xor(x,y) = a) =
(y = xor'(x, a)).
forall x:hasht,y:hasht; xor'(x, xor'(x,y)) = y.
forall x:hasht,y:hasht,z:hasht; (xor'(x,z) = xor'(y,z)) = (x = y).
equiv !nx new a:hasht; (x:hasht) -> xor'(a,x)
      <=(0)=>
      !nx new a:hasht; (x:hasht) -> a.
does not work either.

See encryptBR93-2b for a variant that works but is not fully
satisfactory.
